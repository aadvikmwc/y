## What is a Full Stack E-commerce Team?

A full stack e-commerce team is a group of individuals with diverse technical and business skills who are collectively responsible for designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining an e-commerce platform and its related systems. Unlike traditional teams focused on specific areas (like front-end development or marketing), a full stack team possesses the breadth and depth to handle the entire e-commerce ecosystem.

Think of it as a one-stop shop for all things e-commerce. They can build your website, manage your database, optimize your marketing campaigns, and ensure a seamless customer experience – all under one umbrella.

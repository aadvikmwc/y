## Key SAFe Agile Coach Certifications

While there isn't a single "SAFe Agile Coach Certification" with that exact name, several SAFe certifications are highly relevant and considered essential for aspiring and practicing Agile Coaches:

*   **SAFe Agilist (SA):** This is often the starting point. It provides a foundational understanding of SAFe principles and practices. While not specifically a coaching certification, it's a prerequisite for many advanced certifications.
*   **SAFe Scrum Master (SSM):** A SAFe Scrum Master facilitates the Scrum process within a SAFe team. While not a coach in the broadest sense, this role builds coaching skills by helping teams self-organize and improve.
*   **SAFe Advanced Scrum Master (SASM):** Building on the SSM certification, the SASM goes deeper into coaching topics and explores how to effectively scale Scrum within an enterprise environment. This certification hones coaching skills for Scrum Masters operating in a SAFe context.
*   **SAFe Release Train Engineer (RTE):** The RTE is a servant leader and coach for the Agile Release Train (ART). This role requires strong coaching skills to facilitate ART events, remove impediments, and drive continuous improvement across multiple teams. *This is often the most direct path to becoming a full-fledged SAFe Agile Coach.*
*   **SAFe Program Consultant (SPC):** SPCs are change agents who lead the adoption of SAFe within an organization. They require strong coaching skills to train, mentor, and guide teams and leaders through the transformation process. This is the highest level of SAFe certification and indicates a deep understanding of agile transformation strategies.

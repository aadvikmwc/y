## What is Spiritual Awakening?

Spiritual awakening is not a one-time event but rather a continuous unfolding. It's a process of shedding old identities, beliefs, and egoic attachments to reveal the authentic self beneath. Some common signs of spiritual awakening include:

*   **A sense of unease or dissatisfaction with your current life:** You may feel like something is missing, even if you have everything you thought you wanted.

*   **A questioning of your values and beliefs:** You start to challenge the assumptions you've always held about yourself and the world.

*   **Increased intuition and synchronicity:** You may notice more meaningful coincidences and gut feelings that guide your decisions.

*   **A desire for deeper connection:** You seek authentic relationships and a sense of belonging.

*   **A greater appreciation for nature and the beauty around you:** Your senses become heightened, and you feel a deeper connection to the natural world.

*   **Empathy and compassion for others:** You become more aware of the suffering in the world and feel a strong desire to help.

*   **A release of fear and anxiety:** As you connect with your true self, you may find that your fears begin to dissolve.

*   **A sense of purpose and meaning:** You feel a strong calling to live a life that is aligned with your values and passions.

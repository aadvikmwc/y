## What Exactly Is a Wildlife Photography Degree?

While there isn't always a degree specifically named "Wildlife Photography," several academic routes can lead you to a successful career in this field.  Think of it as a specialized application of broader photography principles. You're essentially learning the fundamentals of photography and then tailoring your skills and knowledge to the unique challenges and rewards of capturing wildlife in its natural habitat.

Common degree paths include:

*   **Photography (BA/BFA):** This is the most direct route. You'll learn the core skills of photography, including composition, lighting, exposure, and post-processing. You can then specialize in wildlife photography through elective courses, independent projects, and self-directed learning.
*   **Fine Arts (BA/BFA):** Similar to photography, a fine arts degree provides a strong foundation in visual arts principles. You can focus on photography as your medium and develop a portfolio showcasing your wildlife images.
*   **Zoology/Biology (BSc):** This might seem surprising, but a science background can be incredibly valuable. It provides a deep understanding of animal behavior, ecology, and conservation issues.  This knowledge is essential for ethical and informed wildlife photography. You can complement your science degree with photography courses or workshops.
*   **Environmental Science (BSc):** Like zoology, environmental science provides a crucial understanding of the context in which wildlife exists. You'll learn about ecosystems, conservation challenges, and the impact of human activities on animal populations.  Photography skills can then be used to document these issues and raise awareness.
*   **Journalism (BA):** A journalism degree, especially with a focus on environmental reporting, can be a great path for wildlife photographers who want to tell stories through their images.  You'll learn how to research, write, and present compelling narratives alongside your photography skills.

## What Will You Learn?

Regardless of the specific degree program, a good wildlife photography education should cover the following areas:

*   **Photography Fundamentals:** This includes understanding aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and their interplay in creating well-exposed images. You'll also learn about different types of lenses, camera bodies, and other essential equipment.
*   **Composition and Visual Storytelling:**  Learning to arrange elements within the frame to create visually appealing and impactful images.  Understanding how to tell a story through your photographs is crucial for engaging viewers and conveying a message.
*   **Lighting Techniques:**  Mastering natural light is paramount in wildlife photography. You'll learn how to work with different types of light, including sunrise, sunset, and overcast conditions, to create stunning images. You might also learn about artificial lighting for specific situations, like capturing nocturnal animals.
*   **Wildlife Behavior and Ecology:** Understanding animal behavior is crucial for predicting their movements, capturing intimate moments, and minimizing disturbance. You'll learn about animal habitats, feeding habits, social structures, and conservation challenges.
*   **Ethical Wildlife Photography:** This is a critical aspect of wildlife photography. You'll learn about responsible practices that minimize your impact on animals and their environment. This includes respecting their space, avoiding stress, and never baiting or manipulating animals for a photograph.
*   **Post-Processing:** Learning to use software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to enhance your images, correct imperfections, and optimize them for print or online display.  Understanding the ethical boundaries of post-processing is also important.
*   **Business and Marketing:** If you plan to pursue wildlife photography as a career, you'll need to learn about business practices, marketing your work, and finding clients or outlets for your images. This might include creating a portfolio website, using social media, and pitching your work to magazines, newspapers, or conservation organizations.
*   **Field Techniques:** Spending time in the field is essential. You'll learn practical skills like tracking animals, setting up camera traps, and working in challenging environments. This might involve hiking, camping, and navigating different terrains.

## Choosing the Right Program

When selecting a wildlife photography program (or a related degree), consider the following factors:

*   **Faculty:** Research the faculty members and their expertise. Look for instructors with a strong background in wildlife photography, conservation, or related fields. Check their portfolios and publications to assess their skills and experience.
*   **Curriculum:** Review the course curriculum carefully. Make sure it covers the key areas mentioned above. Look for opportunities to specialize in wildlife photography through elective courses, independent projects, or internships.
*   **Facilities and Equipment:**  Does the program have well-equipped photography studios, darkrooms (if relevant), and access to cameras, lenses, and other equipment? Does it provide opportunities for field trips and hands-on learning experiences in natural settings?
*   **Location:** Consider the location of the program. Are there opportunities to photograph wildlife in the surrounding area? Some programs may be located near national parks, wildlife refuges, or other areas with abundant wildlife.
*   **Internship Opportunities:**  Does the program offer internship opportunities with conservation organizations, wildlife magazines, or other relevant institutions? Internships can provide valuable experience and networking opportunities.
*   **Cost and Financial Aid:** Consider the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses. Explore financial aid options, such as scholarships, grants, and loans.

*   **Command:** The command or script to be executed.
*   **Machine:** The target server where the job will be executed.
*   **Owner:** The user who owns the job.
*   **Dependencies:**  The jobs that must complete successfully before this job can be executed.
*   **Start Time:** The time when the job should be started.
*   **Run Frequency:** The frequency with which the job should be executed (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
*   **Exit Code:** The expected exit code of the job.

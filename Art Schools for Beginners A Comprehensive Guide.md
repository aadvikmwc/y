## What is an Art School?

They often boast state-of-the-art facilities and a strong focus on studio practice.

Selecting the right art school is a personal decision that depends on your individual goals, interests, and circumstances. Here are some factors to consider:

## Preparing Your Portfolio

For many art school applications, a portfolio is essential. Itâ€™s a visual representation of your artistic skills, creativity, and potential. Here's how to approach it:

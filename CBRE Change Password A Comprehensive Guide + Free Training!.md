## Why Changing Your CBRE Password Regularly Matters

Changing your password regularly, even if you haven't noticed any suspicious activity, is a fundamental security practice. Here's why:

*   **Mitigating Breach Risks:** Data breaches are becoming increasingly common. If a company you interact with experiences a breach, your password might be compromised. Regularly changing your password minimizes the impact of such incidents.
*   **Preventing Account Takeover:** Hackers use various techniques, including phishing and malware, to steal passwords. If your CBRE account is compromised, they could access sensitive company information, client data, or even your personal details.
*   **Combating Password Reuse:** Many people reuse the same password across multiple accounts. If one of those accounts is breached, all accounts with the same password become vulnerable. Using unique passwords and changing them regularly drastically reduces this risk.
*   **Meeting Compliance Requirements:** Many organizations, including CBRE, have internal policies that mandate regular password changes to comply with industry regulations and maintain a strong security posture.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Changing Your CBRE Password

While the exact steps may vary slightly depending on the specific CBRE system you're using, the general process usually follows these lines:

1.  **Identify the System:** Determine which CBRE system or application you need to change the password for (e.g., internal portal, email, specific software).
2.  **Access the Login Page:** Go to the login page for the relevant system.
3.  **Look for the "Forgot Password" or "Change Password" Option:** Most login pages have a link that allows you to reset or change your password. It might be labeled "Forgot Password," "Change Password," "Reset Password," or something similar.
4.  **Verify Your Identity:** You'll likely be asked to verify your identity. This usually involves entering your username, email address, or answering security questions you set up previously.
5.  **Receive a Password Reset Link or Code:** Depending on the system, you'll either receive a password reset link via email or a code via SMS or email.
6.  **Create a New Password:** Click the link or enter the code to access the password reset page. On this page, you'll be prompted to create a new password.
7.  **Follow Password Requirements:** Pay close attention to the password requirements. These often include a minimum length, a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
8.  **Confirm Your New Password:** Enter your new password again to confirm it.
9.  **Save Your New Password:** After successfully changing your password, make sure to save it securely. Consider using a password manager (more on that later).
10. **Log In With Your New Password:** Test your new password by logging into the CBRE system.

## Password Security Best Practices

Creating a strong password and managing it securely are essential. Here are some best practices to follow:

*   **Create Strong, Unique Passwords:**

    *   **Length Matters:** Aim for at least 12 characters, but longer is better.
    *   **Mix It Up:** Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).
    *   **Avoid Personal Information:** Don't use easily guessable information like your name, birthday, pet's name, or address.
    *   **Randomness is Key:** Strive for randomness. Avoid common words, phrases, or keyboard patterns.
*   **Use a Password Manager:**

    *   **What is a Password Manager?** A password manager is a software application that securely stores your passwords and can generate strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Strong Password Generation:** Password managers can create complex and random passwords that are difficult to crack.
        *   **Secure Storage:** They encrypt your passwords and store them securely, protecting them from theft.
        *   **Auto-Filling:** Password managers can automatically fill in your usernames and passwords on websites and apps, saving you time and effort.
        *   **Synchronization:** Many password managers synchronize your passwords across multiple devices, allowing you to access them from your computer, phone, or tablet.
    *   **Popular Options:** Some popular password managers include LastPass, 1Password, Dashlane, and Bitwarden.
*   **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**

    *   **What is MFA?** MFA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring you to provide two or more factors of authentication to verify your identity.
    *   **How it Works:** In addition to your password, you might need to enter a code sent to your phone, use a fingerprint scanner, or use a security key.
    *   **Why it's Important:** Even if someone steals your password, they won't be able to access your account without the additional authentication factor.
*   **Be Wary of Phishing:**

    *   **What is Phishing?** Phishing is a type of cyberattack where criminals attempt to trick you into giving up your personal information, such as your username, password, or credit card details.
    *   **How it Works:** Phishing emails often impersonate legitimate organizations, such as banks or CBRE itself. They might contain links to fake websites that look like the real thing.
    *   **How to Protect Yourself:**
        *   **Be Suspicious of Unexpected Emails:** Be wary of emails that you weren't expecting, especially those asking for sensitive information.
        *   **Check the Sender's Address:** Verify that the sender's email address is legitimate. Look for misspellings or unusual domain names.
        *   **Don't Click on Suspicious Links:** Hover over links before clicking on them to see where they lead. If the URL looks suspicious, don't click on it.
        *   **Report Phishing Attempts:** If you receive a phishing email, report it to CBRE's IT security team or the appropriate authority.
*   **Update Your Software Regularly:** Keeping your operating system, web browser, and other software up to date is crucial for security. Software updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.
*   **Avoid Using Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Transactions:** Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured, making it easier for hackers to intercept your data. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions, such as logging into your CBRE account or accessing confidential information. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your data.

## What to Do if You Suspect Your CBRE Account Has Been Compromised

If you suspect that your CBRE account has been compromised, take immediate action:

1.  **Change Your Password Immediately:** Change your password for the affected account as quickly as possible.
2.  **Notify CBRE's IT Security Team:** Contact CBRE's IT security team or your manager to report the incident. They can help you investigate the issue and take steps to secure your account.
3.  **Monitor Your Account Activity:** Keep a close eye on your account activity for any suspicious transactions or unauthorized access.
4.  **Review Your Security Settings:** Review your security settings for the affected account and make sure they are properly configured. Enable MFA if it's available.
5.  **Scan Your Computer for Malware:** Run a full scan of your computer using a reputable antivirus program to check for malware.

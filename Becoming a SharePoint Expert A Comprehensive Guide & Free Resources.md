## Choosing the Right Path: SharePoint Development vs. Administration

As you delve deeper into the world of SharePoint, you'll notice two primary paths: development and administration. While both are crucial for successful SharePoint implementations, they require different skill sets and focus on different aspects of the platform.

**SharePoint Development:** Focuses on extending and customizing SharePoint's functionality through coding and development. This involves using technologies like SPFx, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Power Apps, and Power BI to create custom web parts, workflows, forms, and applications that integrate with SharePoint data. Developers are responsible for building solutions that meet specific business needs and enhance the user experience.

**SharePoint Administration:** Focuses on managing and maintaining the SharePoint environment. This involves configuring settings, managing user permissions, monitoring performance, ensuring security, and troubleshooting issues. Administrators are responsible for ensuring that SharePoint is running smoothly and efficiently, and that users have access to the resources they need.

While some individuals may specialize in one area or the other, a well-rounded SharePoint expert should have a basic understanding of both development and administration.

## The Future of SharePoint Expertise

SharePoint continues to evolve as part of the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, integrating more deeply with other applications like Teams, OneDrive, and Power Platform. This means that the skills required for SharePoint experts are also evolving.
